# Cross-compiling requires CMake 2.6 or newer. To use it from build/, call it
# like this:
# cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../XCompile.txt -DHOST=i686-pc-mingw32
# Where 'i686-pc-mingw32' is the host prefix for your cross-compiler. If you
# already have a toolchain file setup, you may use that instead of this file.

# the name of the target operating system
SET(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Windows)

# which compilers to use for C and C++
SET(CMAKE_C_COMPILER "${HOST}-gcc")
SET(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER "${HOST}-g++")

# here is where stuff gets installed to
SET(CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX "/usr/${HOST}/usr")

# here is the target environment located
SET(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH "/usr/${HOST}/usr")

# adjust the default behaviour of the FIND_XXX() commands:
# search headers and libraries in the target environment, search 
# programs in the host environment
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY ONLY)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE ONLY)
