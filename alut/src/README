The files in this directory make up the ALUT library.

They compile to make 'libalut.so' for Linux/BSD/UNIX/MacOS or to 'ALUT.DLL' for
Windows machines.

There is also a header file 'alut.h' which goes into /usr/include/AL/alut.h for Linux/BSD/UNIX/MacOS - and...someplace else entirely for Windows machines.

The file 'helloworld.wav' is the original voice recording of Steve Baker saying
this immortal phrase.  It is converted into a large hexadecimal data block
inside alutWaveform.c - but this file is retained in version control just
in case anyone ever feels like re-doing it.
