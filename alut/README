The freealut library.
=====================
             by Steve Baker.

freealut is a free implementation of OpenAL's ALUT standard.


INSTALLATION:

Under most OS's, you can simply run (as 'root'):

   ./configure ; make install

...but under Windows (unless you are using the Cygwin
environment), you'll need to read 'README.win32'

Once ALUT is installed, you may change directory to 'test_suite'
or 'examples' and run 'make' to build test programs and example
programs.

SUPPORT:

Please don't email me (Steve Baker) directly - I
get *WAY* too much mail as it is!  Instead, please
sign up to the OpenAL user's mailing list.  Instructions
can be found here:

  http://www.openal.org


LICENSING:

These libraries are offered as OpenSource freeware
under the provisions of the GNU Library Public
License (LGPL). Those terms and conditions are
detailed in the file 'LICENSE' in this directory.


REQUIREMENTS:

In addition to the libraries that I provide, you
will also need OpenAL (OpenAL 1.0 or later)
and a sound card that supports OpenAL.


DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:

ALUT expects to be installed in one standard place:

  /usr/lib

...with header files at:

  /usr/include/AL


PORTABILITY and DEPENDANCIES:

This library is designed to be easily portable (and
more importantly so that programs using it can be
UTTERLY portable).


COMPILING/LINKING WITH ALUT

In your source code, add:

     #include <AL/alut.h>

Add this to your link line:

  -lalut -lopenal -lpthread -lm


DIRECTORIES

Within this distribution, you will find the following directories:

src        -- The source code for the ALUT library itself.
doc        -- The ALUT documentation.
test_suite -- A small suite of test programs to check that ALUT is
              installed and working correctly.
examples   -- For application authors, here is a small collection of
              example programs that you can use to get you started.
