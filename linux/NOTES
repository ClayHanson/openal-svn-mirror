NOTES:
	GENERAL:
	A few functions are either missing or stubbed out.  If 
	you need a function implemented in a hurry, please email me.
	99% of the stub/missing functions things need just a little
	glue.

	FILTERS:
	Filter functionality is uneven at the moment.  Except for
	alf_da, they suffer from deviations from their "specified"
	behaviour.  The frequency based filters deviate the most
	(if implemented at all).

	API:
	I've added the header file AL/alkludge.h for stuff that 
	I know needs to either change or be removed but haven't 
	got around to it yet.  For example, alcParamater1f.
	That's a function that's about to go (in favor of alAttenuation*)
	so I've stuck it there.
