Please check the individual OS-specific directories for OpenAL installation
information. Note that the "linux" subdirectory is not meant to be used on its
own, but is a part of the "portable" CVS module.

The OpenAL Utility Toolkit (ALUT) is in it's own directory that is
OS-independent.  Install ALUT *after* installing OpenAL.
