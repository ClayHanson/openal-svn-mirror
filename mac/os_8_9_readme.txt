To do a build for OS 8 or 9, just bring up the openal_mac_cw6.mcp project into CodeWarrior 6 or 7 and build the 
OpenAL Library target.  To test the new library, build the DemoApp target.  There are Carbon versions of both 
the library and DemoApp -- neither are distributed but are there for your use if you want them.
